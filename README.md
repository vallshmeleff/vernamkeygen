<b>Czech Entropy PRNG</b><br>
Prototype of an Android Java application for generating the same keys for the Vernam cipher for the sender and recipient of messages without a synchronization channel. Based on the entered text, the application creates an array of "random" numbers. The array is the same for the same source text. An irreversible, formula-free transformation of input data (text) with subsequent sampling of values is used.<br>
The application DOES NOT encode data. The application prepares an array for use in applications like <b>Czech Encode</b><br>
An application <b>Czech Entropy PRNG</b> ( http://czechentropy.freetzi.com/ ) was created based on this project - CzechEntropy.APK<br>
